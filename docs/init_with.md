You can override the default Clowne method which generates a _plain_ copy of a source object.
By default, Clowne initiatas the clone record using a `#dup` method.

For example, Cloners could be used not only to generate _fresh_ new models but to apply some transformations to the existing record:


```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_one :profile
  has_many :posts
end

class UserCloner < Clowne::Cloner
  adapter :active_record

  include_association :profile

  trait :copy_settings do
    # Use a `target` for all the actions
    init_with { |_source, target:| target }
  end
end

jack = User.find_by(email: 'jack@evl.ms')
john = User.find_by(email: 'john@evl.ms')

# we want to clone Jack's profile settings to another user,
# without creating a new one
UserCloner.call(jack, traits: :copy_settings, target: john)
```
