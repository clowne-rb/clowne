Why did we decide to build our own cloning gem?

First, existing solutions turned out not stable and flexible enough for us.

Secondly, they are Rails-only. And we are not.

Nevertheless, thanks to [amoeba](https://github.com/amoeba-rb/amoeba) and [deep_cloneable](https://github.com/moiristo/deep_cloneable) for inspiration.
